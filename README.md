#TrafficSimulation

##The program
This is a simulation program I made with LibGDX. To try it out, please go to the [releases](https://github.com/ThomasdenH/TrafficSimulation/releases).

The simulation is based on the [Intelligent Driver Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model). The program demonstrates that traffic jams can appear from small deviations in the positions of individual drivers.
